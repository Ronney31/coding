Youâ€™re given the pointer to the head node of a linked list and an integer to add to the list. 
Create a new node with the given integer, insert this node at the head of the linked list and return the new head node. 
The head pointer given may be null meaning that the initial list is empty.


Insert Node at the begining of a linked list
Initially head pointer argument could be NULL for empty list
Node is defined as 
struct Node
{
     int data;
     struct Node *next;
}
return back the pointer to the head of the linked list in the below method.
